```

You can run tests by entering the container shell and running pytest or opening the provided devcontainer and running the vscode test runner. View the [docs](./docs/) for more information.

- This repository uses a devcontainer to allow for dynamic development inside of pygeoapi while isolating our code
- the `.gitignore` ignores all files but ours so that we can work inside a
